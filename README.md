# Products App

This project is a simple React application that provides user authentication and allows managing a list of products. It includes features such as viewing products, adding new products, editing existing products, and deleting products.

## Features

- User authentication (login).
- Viewing a list of products with pagination.
- Adding, editing, and deleting products.
- Modal dialogs for creating and editing products, implemented using React Portals.
- State management using Redux.
- API integration using Axios.
- Form validation with `react-hook-form`.
- Responsive and modern UI design.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pollyv/VizorLabs_Module4_Products.git
cd VizorLabs_Module4_Products
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the development server

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### 4. Authentication and access to the product list

There is no provision for creating users in this API, so you can use this username and password to log in and access the list of products.

```bash
login: emilys
password: emilyspass
```
